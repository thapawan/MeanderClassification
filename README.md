# Overview
The Southeastern United States rivers meander classification based on geometric properties such as sinuosity, wavelength, length, amplitude, width and Normalized Meander Curvature Index (NMCI).This study investigates the influence of geometric properties and physiographic regions on river meander classification in the southeastern United States. We employed four machine learning models—Gradient Boosting Machine, Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—to classify meanders based on their amplitude, wavelength, sinuosity, water-surface width, and Normalized Meander Curvature Index (NMCI).
# Machine Learning Models
- Gradient Boosting Machine
- Neural Network
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
# Geometric Properties
- Amplitude
- Wavelength
- Sinuosity
- Water-surface width
- Normalized Meander Curvature Index (NMCI)
# Statistical Analyses
- Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
- Kruskal-Wallis tests
- Tukey’s HSD post-hoc comparisons
# Results
Our statistical analyses revealed significant differences in geometric properties among meander classes and across physiographic regions (Coastal Plain, Piedmont, Appalachian Plateau). Among the machine learning models, the Random Forest model demonstrated the highest classification accuracy at 85%, outperforming the Decision Tree (82%), Neural Network (77%), and Gradient Boosting Machine (67%).
